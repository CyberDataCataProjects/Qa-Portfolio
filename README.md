How to use
1. Review the TEST_PLAN.md to understand scope and objectives.
2. Use TEST_CASES.md or the CSV to run manual tests against a public demo site (suggested: https://demoqa.com).
3. Log bugs using BUG_REPORT_TEMPLATE.md and file issues using the GitHub Issue template.
4. Keep test execution records in SAMPLE_TEST_EXECUTION_REPORT.csv.

Interview tips
- Walk interviewers through the TEST_PLAN and one or two test cases end-to-end.
- Show how you would prioritize, reproduce, and communicate a bug using the provided template.
- Mention how you would add automation and CI as next steps (see "How I'd extend this" section in TEST_PLAN.md).
